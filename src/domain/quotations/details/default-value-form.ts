    "Regulatory Compliance\nThe Buyer acknowledges that the RGB and/or its affiliates are subject to gaming, lottery or similar licensing requirements of various jurisdictions. The Buyer shall cooperate fully with the RGB and its affiliates in providing to them any information of whatever nature that any of them deems necessary or appropriate in assuring itself that the Buyer possesses the good character, honesty, integrity, and reputation applicable to those engaged in the gaming and lottery industries. The Buyer represents and warrants that there is nothing in its background, history or reputation that would be deemed unsuitable under any standard applicable to such industries. If, during the term of this Agreement, the RGB (or any of its affiliates) is notified (formally or informally) by any governmental authority that the engagement of, or conducting business with the Buyer may or will jeopardize any license or ability to be licensed of the RGB (or any of its affiliates), or if the RGB (or any of its affiliates) concludes that the Buyer may fail to meet the above criteria (or the Compliance Committee of the RGB or any of its affiliates otherwise raises an objection with respect to the Buyer), the RGB may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Buyer without incurring any liability for damages therefore.\n\nCompliance Representations, Warranties and Covenants \nThe Buyer represents, warrants and covenants to the RGB as follows:\n\nAll information furnished by the Buyer to the RGB in connection with the RGB’s due diligence and compliance review process is complete and accurate. \nThe Buyer has not been convicted of or pleaded guilty or “no contest” to a criminal offense and, to the best of its knowledge, is not the subject of any government investigation. \nThe Buyer has not offered or paid, and will not offer or pay, directly or indirectly:\nanything of value to any Public Official or candidate for political office, or any relative or agent thereof, for purposes of obtaining any official action or benefit relating in any way to this Agreement; or\nany commission or finder’s or referral fee to any person or entity in connection with this Agreement, or any activities on behalf of the RGB.\n\nAnti-Corruption Representations and Warranties\nIn addition to other representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement, the Buyer also represents, and warrants that at the date of the execution of this Agreement, and throughout the term hereof:\nThe Buyer shall not violate or cause the RGB, its subsidiaries or affiliates to be in violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, competition, licensing and registration. The Buyer shall promptly notify the RGB in writing in the event of any actual or alleged breach of any such laws without undue delay.\nNeither the Buyer nor its owners, directors, officers or employees shall (directly or indirectly through third parties) offer, promise, give, authorize, solicit or accept any undue pecuniary, financial benefits, object of value or other advantage of any kind, directly or indirectly, in any way connected with this Agreement to any third party, in particular any Public Official or Entity, anywhere in the world, in order to:\ninfluence the Public Official in his or her official duties and capacity; \ninduce or reward either favourable treatment or the improper performance of a relevant function or activity; or \nobtain or retain business, or directing business to, any person for a financial or business advantage.\n\nA “Public Official or Entity” means (i) an officer, employee, agent, contractor or representative of any government or military, including, but not limited to, a customs official; (ii) any department, agency, corporate entity, instrumentality or political subdivision of any government or military; (iii) any person or commercial entity acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any government or military; (iv) any candidate for political office, any political party or any official of a political party; or (v) any officer, employee, agent, contractor or representative of any public international organization. \n\nThe Buyer shall ensure that no part of any payment, compensation, reimbursement or fee paid by the RGB to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement will be used as a corrupt payment, gratuity, emolument, bribe, kickback or other improper benefit to any third party or Public Official or Entity. \n\nThere have been no accusations, allegations, claims, investigations, informal inquiries, indictments, prosecutions, charges or other enforcement actions against the Buyer relating to bribery, corruption, money laundering, fraud or any other legal or ethical violation and to the Buyer’s knowledge, its owners, directors, officers, employees, agents and third party representatives have never violated any anti-bribery and corruption laws. The Buyer shall promptly notify the RGB in writing in the event of any such incidences without undue delay. \n\nThe Buyer has in good faith, provided to the RGB all documents and information of the character and type requested by the RGB in the course of its due diligence review of the Buyer, and to the Buyer’s knowledge, there are no documents or information of a character or type requested by the RGB which have not been so provided by the Buyer. \n\nThe Buyer shall, in connection with this Agreement, maintain accurate books and records. Upon seven (7) days prior notice to the Buyer, and at the RGB’s own expense, the RGB and/or its third party accountant may audit, inspect and/or copy the Buyer’s detailed accounting books and financial records, which are subjected to the confidentiality agreed between both Parties for the purpose of verifying compliance with the terms of this Agreement. \n\nIn the event that the RGB, as a result of the exercise of a contractually-provided audit right of the accounting books and financial records, or otherwise, brings evidence that the Buyer has been in breach of any of the representations, covenants or warranties contained within this clause, the RGB shall notify the Buyer without undue delay, and require the Buyer to take necessary remedial action within a reasonable time. \n\nIf the Buyer fails to take the necessary remedial action, the RGB, may at its discretion, either suspend or terminate this Agreement and pursue the remedies, without prejudice to all other available remedies, as far as permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the above, termination of this Agreement will occur automatically in the event an applicable court of law or tribunal finds a breach of any representations, covenants or warranties under this clause. \n\nThe Buyer shall inform the RGB if there are any material changes to the nature of their business or key personnel (e.g. business owners, shareholders, management, board members, principal officers or employees who are key to the related transaction) that may have an adverse impact on the Buyer’s continual compliance with the applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption stipulations hereof, as well as the RGB’s Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy.",
